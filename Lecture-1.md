## Beginning remarks

> "Programming is more about problem solving more generally...What ultimately matters in this course is not so much where you end up relative to your classmates but where you end up relative to yourself when you began"

- I've found that this quote becomes more and more true the more i dive into programming. While at this point im 1 year into my associates in computer science, even looking at the basics can be a daunting task. Today i was just refreshing my memory on my last semesters class "intro to Javascript" ultimately it was not as intimidating as it was when i took the class but still reading my own code was frustrating, trying to remember what every method meant. But with that being said still remembering SOME of the basics is encouraging almost like reading a foreign language and being able to pick out just a few words of a sentence and from there getting a basic idea about what a function was doing. All of this to say, there is a lot of gratification even amongst frustration in finding out there is still more to learn, I can learn and grow as a programmer.

## What language do computers speak?

- What is binary?
- Binary is the computers native language which is represented as 0's and 1's
- Binary digits aka bits, is a combination of 0's and 1's or more accurately the 0 or 1 itself is a byte. which represents a piece of data.
- Computers and phones or any electronic device has switches called transistors that only have one function and that is to store electricity or not store electricity, this is where the 1's and 0's come into play. If a transistor holds electricity this is read as a 1 and if it is not storing electricity it is read as a 0.
- Computers do not count in the way that humans do, they do not count in a sequence. Humans typically count unaryily, but computers count by 1's and 0's. Therefore in order for computers to count past 1 they have to represent numbers in a pattern, this pattern is known as binary.
- Computers have standardized how many bits we use which is 8.
- When it comes to numbers and letters we need to use the same system of 1's and 0's to represent both. With 8 bits we can use the numerous patters to represent both numbers and letters and a few punctuation. We all just need to agree on what binary pattern means what. With as many transistors as devices have these days being able to count up to however much we want we have an infinite combination of patterns to represent numbers and letters.
- Now for a computer to interpret a set of binary that can represent a number and a letter is based on the context that the data is stored in i.e file type.
- ASCII: American Standard code for information interchange.
  - This is the standardization of binary to represent numbers and letters as far as how a computer is to interpret the binary.
- One byte is made up of 8 bits. Typically we only use one byte (8bits) to represent a number and or a letter.
- If you only have 8 bits you can only count up to 255. But now that we can store data in a byte we can count higher, we can count much higher if more data is stored in a megabyte etc.

### Thoughts

- Generally speaking this section of the lecture (about 30 min in) is about how information in the form of binary is compiled to represent different forms of data i.e numbers, letters, color, pictures, etc. I did not write as many notes as I probably should but once we figure out how to represent numbers and letters, colors and pictures/ videos becomes somewhat self explanatory. Again this section of the lecture is all about how do we represent data and how do we get a computer to interpret said data.

## Algorithms

- What is an algorithm?
  - An algorithm in its basic form is a set of instructions that tell a computer what to do. However algorithms are generally very complex and can be lengthy.
  - Some algorithms are more efficient than others, and in some cases just bad at solving a problem.
- What is psudocode?
  - This is generally just plain language for step by step directions for what one is trying to accomplish. Psudocode is then translated to actual code.
- What is a Function?
  - Most programming languages typically have a function key word that indicates some sort of verb or action to accomplish a small task. Typically a program is comprised of many functions to accomplish many or one specific task.
- Conditionals?
  - This is generally if else statements or boolean expressions.
- Loops?
  - Fairly self explanatory a set of instructions that are on repeat till the task is completed.
- Note that with functions, conditionals or loops, like with algorithms, we can write bad versions, of these ideas that do not accomplish what we want to do.
- Events?
  - These are user inputs. This can be anything from clicking on a screen or pressing a specific or a combination of keys on a key board, or even basic voice commands.
- What is Nesting?
  - This seems to be the concept of putting functions within functions. Or in other words taking the output of one function and using it as an input to another within the same function. (This is probably a bad explanation or just wrong).
- Arguments and parameters
  - this is just inputs. this comes from a function or something the user input which just makes it the output of a function.
